# Demonetization-Analysis-
About the project:

This project investigates the comprehensive impact of India’s 2016 demonetisation policy, which invalidated ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes—86% of the currency in circulation at the time. The policy, announced by the Government of India on November 8, 2016, aimed to combat black money, eliminate counterfeit currency, curb corruption, and promote a cashless economy.

The report explores both the short-term disruptions and long-term structural implications across multiple sectors including agriculture, retail, SMEs, banking, and digital finance. It examines the immediate liquidity crunch and its adverse effects on GDP, employment, consumption, and market sentiment. Simultaneously, it tracks positive outcomes such as the rise in digital payments, increased tax compliance, and financial inclusion.

The study employs a mixed-method approach—analyzing macroeconomic indicators, digital transaction data, stock market responses, and survey feedback from impacted sectors. It also presents a critical review of existing literature and fills research gaps related to regional disparities, informal sector responses, and policy overlaps with GST.

Key insights highlight that while demonetisation accelerated digital adoption and widened the tax base, its effectiveness in curbing black money remains debatable. The policy’s execution challenges and economic trade-offs serve as valuable lessons in future monetary planning.

This research was conducted by a student team from Punjab Engineering College under the guidance of Dr. Rakesh Kumar, and it reflects an academic attempt to assess one of India’s most controversial economic reforms.
